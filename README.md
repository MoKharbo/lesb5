# How to make shawarma
### Make the shawarma spice mixture. Simply add the spices into a small bowl and mix to combine.

## Shawarma Spice Mixture
### Cut up some boneless, skinless chicken thighs into small bite-size pieces (you can use chicken breast if you like, this is just my personal preference.)

## Boneless chicken cut up into small pieces
### Spice the chicken up, make sure to coat the chicken well with the spice mixture. Add onions, lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil. If you have the time, cover and refrigerate for 3 hours or overnight (if you don’t, you can skip the marinating time, it’ll still be delicious)

## Chicken pieces, combined with shawarma spices, lemon juice and olive oil.
### When ready, lay the chicken shawarma on a large sheet pan and bake in 425 degrees heated oven for 30 minutes or so (you can check a bit earlier as ovens do vary.)
